## About me  
I am Statistic's Major and Psychology Minor. This is my last statistics course here at Grand Valley till I graduate. My Ideal occupation would to work for one of the major sports leagues around the U.S., analytics and probability are something I really enjoying learning about, specifically how certain statistics can effect the outcome of games. Probably a big reason why my favorites moveis are *Money Ball* and *21*(First one is about Baseball and 2nd is about the MIT Blackjack Team). I am a a big fan of the Chicago Cubs, Blackhawks and Bears(Be kind I know they all some-what suck right now). I grew up 45 minutes outside of Chicago and came to Grand Valley 4.5 Years ago. Currently, I reside in Grand Rapids, but do eventually want to move back home and move closer to the city.

## Why  
I am taking this course with the hopes of expanding my knowledge in R, and being able to utilize the schools when in comes to occupations outside of a school setting later in life. It is also requirement for my major so that is another reason I am in the course. I think this course be helpful in visualizing data and keeping track of everything through github while allowing for collaboration with others as well.  

## Inspiration  
Some the people I folllow are Sports Statisticians, they will post about expected outcomes of games, or the percentages of true Strikes and Balls in baseball games. Another one I follow would be hockey statisticians, they will post if a player is playing above there salary, how they are doing on defense and offense through WAR ratings and as well as varaibles that factor into expected goals.

## Interesting facts about me  
* I have built 3 computers in my life time, I enjoy the challenge it presents with fitting everything into certain places(One could say quite an expensive hobby). There is still very much I do not know when comes to setting them up or troubleshooting(Windows loves to throw errrors sometimes). 
* Other things I like to do are go hiking or travel, last summer I went to Makinac Island for the first time and that was a very fun experience.
* One final fact is Portillos is my favorite restaurant, my order is : Italian Beef with Sweet Peppers, Hotdog with everything(Chicago Style hotdog), Onion Rings, and a Large Chocolate Cake Shake.
